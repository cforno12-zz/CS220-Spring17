CS-220, Spring 2017 Homework 08, Due April 30, 2017

Build and run the code in fact.c (a Makefile is provided).
 
Run fact.c under gdb, and set a breakpoint in the factorial function in the "then" block of "if (n<2)". 
(It's easiest to set a breakpoint at one of the x86 instructions generated from "answer=n".) 

When you reach the breakpoint, fill in the following table with information gathered from gdb (using 
instructions like "print $rbp" and "x /20xg %rsp", but remember the "x" command in gdb lists memory data 
from low address to high address, we are used to showing memory from high address to low address.) 

Enter 1 row for each stack frame on the stack up to and including the frame where caller's %ebp
is zero (which indicates that the caller is the operating system.) Put an "n/a" in the table for 
entries which are not relevant.

Then submit the edited version of this file in myCourses under hw08.
