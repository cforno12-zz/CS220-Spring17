# Sometimes its easier to create x86 assembler code in a file like this hack.s file
# The Makefile has a command to assemble this file and produce a hack.o file that has
# the binary instructions.
# 
# Use "objdump -d hack.o" to disassemble these instructions
# Use "objdump -h -j.text" to show exactly where these binary instruction are within the hack.o file
#
# Put your x86 assembler code below....
